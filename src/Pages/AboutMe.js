                I've lived in the Madison Area in Wisconsin for about 10 years and before that lived in San Jose, California.
                Half of my family is in Romania so I spent many summers there while growing up (I'm also fluent in Romanian).

                From elementary school to high school I was conviced that I was going to go to art school and become an artist full-time.
                While that didn't end up being the case I do still like making art when I can find the time. 
                Actually, I'd also say I use art as a skill a lot more in my work than I thought I would when I decided to go into Computer Science.
                Obviously art is important when thinking about inteface design but even more than that I've found myself having to make a number of animations and graphics for app development as a part of my work in the People and Robots Lab.
