                I've lived in the Madison area in Wisconsin for about 10 years and before that lived in San Jose, California.
                Half of my family is in Romania so I spent many summers there growing up (I'm also fluent in Romanian).

            <body>
                I enjoy making visual art in my free time (oil painting and sculpture primarily, but I've dabbled in a bunch of mediums).
                I also enjoy cooking and collecting antique textbooks. My best find is/was a German anatomy textbook from 1855.
